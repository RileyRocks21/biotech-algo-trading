# DarkPool Pro Dashboard

Frontend for the data visualization. Built with React + Vite because it's fast.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Notes

- The "BlurWall" component is there to simulate the paywall for non-pro users.
- Data is currently mocked in `AlertTable.jsx` until we hook up the Python backend to a real API/DB (probably Firebase).
- Styling is all Tailwind. Trying to keep it looking like a Bloomberg terminal or TradingView.
